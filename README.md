# Parallel-Matrix-Multiplication-Assignment

This is an assignment.
The goal was for us to implement Matrix multiplication and then implement data parallelism strategies on this process.

In this implementation, we have:

- Sequential Implementation,
- Block Parallelism and
- Modulo Parallelism.

_NOTE_ it is worth noting that in my Implementation I hard coded the matrix in my main function.
